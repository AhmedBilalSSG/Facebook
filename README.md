# Facebook
This is a Console Base Facebook application that is utilizing all the concepts of Object Oriented Language in c++
# Introduction
This Project is the backend Development of Facebook, which is totally made with Motivation
and Inspiration with Facebook. Today Facebook has very wide scope in every field. Modern
technology communication has turned the entire world into global village. With the
improvement in Technologies and power of social media today people depend on these
things as they are needed in every aspect of there work and life. My project is not the entire
backend development but I have tried my best to create it like Original, Since it is console
based so it can not given a shape of Original.
# Purpose of Development:
The purpose of Development is that we should learn about that how thing work at backend
how data is stored and how it is used to give us a best interface and live environment. After
developing this a Developer would be able to build more apps like this and this would help a
developer to work more finely and he can develop Backend Programs at Large Scale. 
# Some features of project:
 The features are same as Facebook provides but some features of the project are as
follows:
• I have designed User interface to Create, Login, and forgot Password of your
account Created.
• You can start Live video, see your Profile, Notifications, Add Bio and Professional
Info.
• Delete Setting option is also available in which you can Edit your Profile Account,
 and Logout Option is also Available.
• Help Center is also created to help users, in which a user can Contact our Staff,
Report a Problem and can also give us a Suggestion (Which would be helpful for me
for future improvements and Developments).
• An administrator account is also created to work on our user Reports, Suggestions
and for Support live chat. The administrator account would have all the features
that are required to Control our whole setup.
• I am further working on my Project to add more features and to create better user
interface for my user
